FreeGEM

GEM was an alternative user interface developed by Digital Research for DOS
and other operating systems in the second half of the 1980s. Years later, its
sources have been released under the GPL and improved by the community under
the name FreeGEM. So enjoy this alternative GUI to get an impression how the
world might have looked like if Windows did not win the GUI race back in the
1990s...
