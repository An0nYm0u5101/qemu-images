MINIX 3 microkernel operating system
------------------------------------
Disk image prepared by Fam Zheng

MINIX 3 is an open source operating system with a very different design: it's
based on a tiny microkernel running in kernel mode with the rest of the
operating system running as a number of isolated, protected, processes in user
mode.
