BootChess
----------------------------------------------
A nice little 512-bytes boot sector chess game

How to play: At prompt, enter for example H7H5 to move the pawn.
Please also read BootChess.txt for more information.

See http://olivier.poudade.free.fr/arc/BootChess.zip for the original
package that also contains other formats of the game (e.g. an even
smaller .COM version that runs from DOS instead).
