# test-images
This is a collection of disk images that can be used by QEMU for testing. These may not be what you are looking for to solve a particular problem, such as implementing an embedded system, but still may be fun to experiment and play around with.

Included are various operating systems, demos, algorithms, and other softwares. To run and test a particular image, go to the respective image's directory and follow the instructions. Each image has a different run script to get it to boot up and run in QEMU.

Several of these disk images actually originated from the QEMU advent calendar sites (http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2014/ and http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2016/). Thank you QEMU and all the contributers who prepared these images for us!
