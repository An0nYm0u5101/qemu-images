=======================================================================

MikeOS is a 16-bit real mode operating system for x86-compatible PCs, 
written entirely in assembly language, which boots from a floppy disk,
CD-ROM or USB key. It features a text-based dialog-driven user
interface, a command-line, support for FAT12 (MS-DOS-like) floppy
disks, sound (PC speaker), text editor, BASIC interpreter and more.
The kernel includes over 60 system calls. MikeOS is a learning tool for
those wishing to understand simple OS construction and x86 assembly.

Have fun, and see the website at http://mikeos.sourceforge.net
