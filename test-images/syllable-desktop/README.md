Information about Syllable from the FAQ at http://web.syllable.org:

The goal of the Syllable project is to create a family of easy-to-use open
source operating systems, for the home and small office user. Syllable Desktop
is an original desktop operating system.

Syllable is currently under development, but it is stable and relatively
mature, with a number of useful applications already available. Syllable
supports a wide range of common hardware devices, including video, network and
sound cards from manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, 3Com, nVidia and Creative. 

Syllable was created in June 2002 as a fork of the AtheOS operating system.
The first release of Syllable, version 0.4.0, was released in July 2002. Since
then, there have been more than twenty releases over three major versions.
