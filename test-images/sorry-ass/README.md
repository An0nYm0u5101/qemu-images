Sorry Ass
---------

A nice little 512-bytes boot sector game, which is a remake of the
DONKEY.BAS game from the early days of the PC. Dodge the donkeys by
pressing a key to switch lanes with your vehicle!

See http://int10h.org/filez/SorryAss.zip for the original package that
also contains other formats of the game (e.g. a .COM version that runs
from DOS instead).
