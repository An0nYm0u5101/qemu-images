Epic Pinball is a 1993 pinball video game developed by James Schmalz
and published by Epic MegaGames. The initial release pre-dated Schmalz'
Digital Extremes name. The game is played seen from a 2D top-down view
within a scrollable window with plain raster graphics in 320x240. It was
noted for being programmed entirely in x86 assembly language for MS-DOS
systems. 

The game was originally distributed on floppy disks in 3 separate packs
of 4 tables each. The original shareware version (and an early retail
version) included only the original "Android" table. Later shareware
versions and retail versions contained an updated version called "Super
Android" (although it's still referred to as "Android" in the game, the
table was changed to say "Super Android")
