# Kali Linux 2.0
Kali Linux 2.0 i386 (32-bit) and amd64 (64-bit) images for QEMU. Images are 25GiB images in QCOW2 format on which a Kali Linux 2.0 system has been installed. The "light" version is a variant of the normal version in which less packages are installed and uses the XFCE desktop environment instead of the default GNOME 3 environment to be able to have a smaller install footprint.
