Originally 86-DOS, written by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products, DOS was a rough clone of CP/M for 8086 based hardware. Microsoft purchased it and licensed it to IBM for use with Microsoft's IBM PC language products. In 1982, Microsoft began licensing DOS to other OEMs that ported it to their custom x86 hardware and IBM PC clones.

MS-DOS "7.1" CDU is a popular custom compilation of MS-DOS and useful utities created by China DOS Union. This custom compilation is designed to aid users who wish to install an advanced MS-DOS environment from CD-ROM or a single set of floppies with minimal hassle.

The underlying version of DOS is the same used under the hood for Windows 95B and Windows 98, which includes support for the FAT32 file system and long filenames.

IMPORTANT: Please be aware that this compilation is not a Microsoft release, but it is provided for your convenience as some people may find it useful.

MS-DOS 7.0 (Windows 95 RTM), MS-DOS 7.1, (Windows 95 OSR2.x and 98), and the crippled MS-DOS 8.0 (Windows ME) were never released by Microsoft as standalone products.

If you want to use this version with Windows 3.x, make sure you disable LFN, as various features of 3.x will generate errors with DOS and will cause programs to unexpectedly crash.
